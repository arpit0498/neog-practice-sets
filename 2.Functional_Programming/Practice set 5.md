# Functional Programming Set 5 (ReactJS)

**Instructions:**

1. Make use of **React JS** **template** in CodeSandbox and **.map()** method in this set. This is not a React JS exercise. There will be **no use of useState or any other React hook**.
2. You can make use of basic methods such as .length, toLowerCase(), toUpperCase() if needed.
3. Do NOT use for-loops.
4. An example has been provided for your understanding. You can find the practice questions below this example.
5. Create your own data for the practice questions where ever needed. You can see the example for reference.

Level UP! Happy Coding. ðŸ˜Š

## Example

You are building a shopping cart app with React. You have an array of objects called items, representing the items in the cart, with each object having the following properties:

```jsx
const items = [
{ id: 1, name: 'Book', price: 10 },
{ id: 2, name: 'T-Shirt', price: 15 },
{ id: 3, name: 'Hat', price: 8 },
{ id: 4, name: 'Sunglasses', price: 12 },
];
```

You also have a variable called total, that contains the total price of all the items in the cart:

```jsx
const total = 45;
```

Using React's map method, write code that generates an unordered list (ul) with one list item (li) for each item in the items array. Each list item should display the item's name and price in the following format:

```jsx
[Item Name]: ([Item Price])
```

The li elements should be wrapped in a div element that contains a heading (h1) with the text "Shopping Cart" and a paragraph (p) that displays the total price in the following format:

```markdown

Total: [Total Price]
```

The li elements should each have a unique key attribute based on the item's id property.

### Solution

```jsx
const items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Book', price: 10 },
  { id: 2, name: 'T-Shirt', price: 15 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Hat', price: 8 },
  { id: 4, name: 'Sunglasses', price: 12 },
];

const total = 45;

function ShoppingCart() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
      <ul>
        {items.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.name}: ({item.price})
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>Total: {total}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
